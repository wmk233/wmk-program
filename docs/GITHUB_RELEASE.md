# GitHub Release Instructions

To create a new release on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed
2. Run the appropriate script for your platform:
   - Windows: `build-tools\create_github_release.bat`
   - macOS/Linux: `build-tools/create_github_release.sh`
3. The script will create a new release with the Windows executable attached

Alternatively, you can create a release manually through the GitHub web interface.
